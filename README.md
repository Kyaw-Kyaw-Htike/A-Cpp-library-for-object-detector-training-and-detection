# A-Cpp-library-for-object-detector-training-and-detection
A C++ library for object detector training and detection 

This C++ library has a subset of the functionalities of [A modular sliding window object detector training and detection system in Java](https://github.com/Kyaw-Kyaw-Htike/A-modular-sliding-window-object-detector-training-and-detection-system-in-Java). This project is however written in pure C++ and the code may not be well organized and clean due to the lack of time to develop and document further.

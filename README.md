# A-Cpp-library-for-object-detector-training-and-detection
A C++ library for object detector training and detection 

This C++ library has a subset of the functionalities of [A modular sliding window object detector training and detection system in Java](https://github.com/Kyaw-Kyaw-Htike/A-modular-sliding-window-object-detector-training-and-detection-system-in-Java). This project is however implemented in pure C++ and the code may not be well organized and clean due to the lack of time to develop and document further. Furthermore, there may be pieces of helper functions, header files, etc. that may be missing in the repository.
